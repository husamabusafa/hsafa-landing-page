## Architecture

The core architecture is built around nodes, queues, and adapters. Nodes encapsulate capabilities, queues manage message flow, and adapters connect Hsafa to external systems.

- **Coordinator**: plans and routes tasks.
- **Worker Nodes**: perform domain-specific work.
- **Storage**: persists state and artifacts.
